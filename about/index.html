      <h2>Our Publishing Philosophy</h2>

      <p>
        We believe effective learning goes beyond information delivery.
        Strong educational resources encourage observation, questioning,
        iteration, and responsibility.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Clear frameworks over jargon</li>
        <li>Real-world relevance over abstract theory</li>
        <li>Ethical awareness alongside creativity</li>
        <li>Learning as a process, not a performance</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>

      <p>
        Tardinova Publications is building a growing catalogue
        of learning resources that support learners across stages —
        from early innovation thinking to responsible entrepreneurship.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are committed to publishing materials that remain relevant,
        adaptable, and grounded in real educational needs.
